## Features 

### The Header Section

- __Navigation Bar__

  Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page and three sub pages - Coaching, Livery, EAL page and is identical in structure for each page to allow for easy navigation. When the user hovers over a one of the menu items it is highlighted. The navigation items are styled to transition to a hamburger menu when the site is reduced in size on a mobile device. This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

## Testing Conducted 

### Usability testing 
I had work colleagues and family members assistance to test the site usability. The conclusion of this testing was that:
- All pages of the site were understandable and easy to use
- Buttons, links, and fields were convenient for use
- There is access to the Main navigation menu from all pages via the desktop version and mobile version.

### Content 

I reviewed all content on the site for:
- grammar and spelling mistakes
- Images are placed properly with proper sizes &    displaying as expected
- Instructions are clear and contain correct information
- Verified all text/ headings are displaying correctly

### Navigation

I tested all the navigation functions via desktop and mobile/ ipad to ensure that they are functioning and linking to the correct pages.

### Links testing

I tested all the hyperlinked text/ images/ nav items to ensure that there were no broken links and that they were linking to the correct locations on the site and/or opening in a new window if expected.

### Effects Testing 

I tested that all hover effects were working for the nav menu/ the image text overlay/ the slideshow arrows.

### Slideshow Gallery 

I tested the slideshow Gallery function on all three sub pages to ensure that they were functioning as expected in Desktop/ mobile/ ipad

### Responsiveness

I used chrome developer tools, [Techsini](http://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php) & [ami](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) throughout all development of the site to ensure that it was responding to all devices down to 300px - 360px width

I tested the site responsiveness on my iphone/ ipad and my family/ friends android mobile devices to ensure the site was rendering and functional across a range of devices.



### Performance

I ran the site through the lighthouse performance tool for developers: 
[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

Given more time I would look at the passive listeners to improve scrolling performance, and also the images/ youtube videos in order to improve the performance score
